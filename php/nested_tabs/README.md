php_nested_tabs
===============

Create nested tabs using PHP &amp; Bootstrap

Caution:

- As this code uses tab names as id's make sure 'outlist' & 'inlist' has unique names.
- Always keep jquery-*.min.js line before bootstrap.min.js for toggle to work correctly.
- No checks done for empty list
- outlist array count should be same as inlist array key count
